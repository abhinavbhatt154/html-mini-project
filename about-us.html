            Welcome to COW SA!<br><br>
            The cow is a gentle and domestic animal, often seen in villages and farms.
It gives us milk, which is rich in nutrients and essential for good health.
Cows are herbivores and mostly eat grass, grains, and fodder.
In many cultures, cows are considered sacred and treated with respect.
Cow dung is used as fuel, fertilizer, and even in rural construction.
